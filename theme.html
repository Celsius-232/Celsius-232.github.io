            <h1>Captain Beatty: Fahrenheit 451</h1>
            <p>In the novel Fahrenheit 451, author Ray Bradbury illustrates that destruction can often lead to hysteria.</p>
            <h2>In Relation to 2018</h2>
            <p>In multiple powers across the world, destruction often leads to hysteria and disarray.</p>
            <p>France: The yellow vest riots are a massive example of destruction. It has had major effects on the world as a whole, even to the extent of bringing a guillotine to a riot. As you can see, not only is destruction present, but so is hysteria.</p>
            <p>Obviously, while censorship is still present today, I believe it has gone down a fair amount. We should definitely care about Bradbury's message, as it brings out multiple complex ideas which are still relevant today. We can apply this in our everyday lives by keeping destruction, however strong of a word, to a minimum, as it has dire consequences.</p>
            
            <h2>Game</h2>
            <p>https://ide.c9.io/skippedravenholm/fahrenheitgame</p>
            <p>This is an interactive representation of Beatty's struggles. The enemies represent abstract nouns which keep appearing throughout Beatty's life, which are shown in the enemies bar.</p>
            <p>This is a visual representation of the theme as it shows how in the end, destroying <i>emotions</i> can lead to major consequences, which are represented with the simple 'Game Over' screen.</p>
            <p>Only works if logged in, due to the language it's coded in.</p>
            <h2>Diary Entry</h2>

            <p>This is a in-depth work which showcases Beatty's emotions when he first becomes a fireman. I've tried to create events in Beatty's life which convey the theme, such as Beatty's first burning, etc.</p>
            
            <h2>Crime Scene Report</h2>
            <p>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ia8FhAk2xMlnw1F8yCaJipVIpiLgJRb48Iz7xZGzS7I/edit?usp=sharing</p>
            <p>This shows Montag's slow descent into insanity, which to an extent, is caused by destruction. It is conveyed as Beatty interrogating Mrs. Phelps. Mrs. Phelps provides a distinct reaction to the public's reaction to someone affected by destuction.</p>
